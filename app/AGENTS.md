# AGENTS.md for /app

This file applies to `/app` and all subdirectories.

## Frontend Prompt Source
- Before proposing or writing frontend code in this scope, read `/app/FRONTEND_DESIGN_PROMPT.md`.
- Treat that file as the active UI/UX and visual design guideline unless the user explicitly overrides it.

## Working Rules
- Match the existing stack, folder conventions, and styling patterns in this repository.
- Centralize design tokens and prefer reusable/composable components over one-off styling.
- Preserve or improve accessibility (semantic structure, keyboard navigation, focus visibility, contrast).
- Ensure responsive behavior across mobile and desktop.
